                        <h4>My History</h4>
                    </div>    
                    <p>My professional life has followed a twisting path, but through it all, 
                        I have been focused on my goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I went to college, I was determined to be a journalist. I envisioned travelling the world, and telling the stories that people needed to hear.
                        However, I got my degree at a time of upheaval in journalism. It changed into something I was uninterested in. Something unstable and still learning what it wants to be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I left college and threw myself into self-study to earn a teaching certificate. I passed the exams in a matter of months, about a third of the time the program takes.
                        Finding a job was not easy, but I was tenacious and was hired by a small K-12 school in mid-western Missouri.
                        I taught there for one year before moving back to KC, where I taught for an additional 8 years in various school districts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I found passion in literacy. I wanted to help my high schoolers, not only function, but succeed in school and in life. 
                        I went back to school and earned a Master's in Education focusing on secondary literacy skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But, then COVID came and education changed completely. It was unreconizable from what it had been even a few months prior to the shutdown. 
                        I lost my passion. I felt unsafe. I felt unappreciated. I knew I had to leave. 
                        I began another self-study program to learn about project management. I earned a Google Certification in about 4 months and began working in construction.

                    <p>
                        Currently, I am taking data analysis courses and studying coding and programming on freeCodeCamp.org. You can see some of my work below.

                    <p>
                        With my soft-skills learned through years of working with struggling and sometimes combative students, as well as the technical skills I have gained in recent years,
                        I am searching for positions that will allow me to use data to inform a company's decision-making. I believe people are far more complex than quantitative numbers can convey,
                        and because of that, I am also interested in qualitative data and how the two types can work together to form a more complete picture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the office, I am a fast learner and a hard worker. I love spreadsheets and collecting and storing information. I am organized and easy to work with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My ideal company is one in which there is a strong sense of accomplishment in the work. I also value companies whose values are similar to my own: people are people first.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I want to find a company that has room for me to grow and learn. But, primarily, I want to work in data analytics and use data to help people.
                    </p>
